<p>Turkish translation of this tutorial is located in the lang folder. İf you would like to add new translation for this guide.You can request.</p>

<p>You can train you own object detection classifier on Windows 10,8 and 7. This repository written with TensorFlow 1.5.0 version. İf you try with newer version of TensorFlow, you can receive too many errors.</p>

<p>Also i published a YouTube video for this tutorial.</p>


<h3>Statement</h3>

<p>You can use TensorFlow (GPU) instead of TensorFlow (CPU) changing "pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow==1.5.0" to "pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade tensorflow-gpu==1.5.0" and you need to install CUDA and cuDNN.</p>

<p>If you use GPU for training,your graphic card should meet minimum requirements. Also yuo should have Nvidia GPU for trainig object detection classifier with TensorFlow.</p>
